Data scraping, string parsing, translation comparing, and machine processing of the accuracy of different translations of English text into Swedish.

Khan academy has 16 million strings of their English text translated into Swedish through a powerful language translation software. However, many of these translations are not entirely correct, and some are entirely wrong. An estimated 60% of all of the translations are no good and need revising. This could take somewhere close to ~30,000 man-hours for humans to proofread. That's not a viable solution to the problem, especially when this has to be done for every language KhanAcademy wants to be translated in.

We taken the strings, before and after translation, and have taken data on all of them regarding features that have a direct impact on their likeliness of being a good or bad string. This data can be used to expedite the process of proofreading and with a more in-depth build of our concept implementation, we would estimate ~25% of all the strings could be immediately approved/rejected without a human ever having to even look. If our data was all fed into a Machine Learning unit, this percentage could increase drastically.
